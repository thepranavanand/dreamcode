  		<p class="content">On February 13, 1963, this Italian astronomer arrived in Rome for trial before Inquisition for professing his theory on Heliocentrism. It was the belief that earth revolves around the Sun and not vice versa as the Roman Catholic Church professed in faith. Some of the arguents he had for his theory were the cyclic nature of tides and comets. For his beliefs he was placed under house arrest till his death.</p>

After just observing the source of all energy and reason for life on Earth the NASA Parker Solar Probe became the first artificial object to enter the upper atmosphere of the sun. The name of this layer is a reference to the 'crown like' appearance it has.</p>

  		<p class="content-name name3">Sushi</p>
  		<p class="content">While this is often seen as a Japanese invention, it was actually created in Southeast Asia. A dish called nare-zushi, which consisted of rice with fish wrapped around it originated someplace by the Mekong River, which is nowhere near Japan. After being created there, it became popular in China before it reached Japan and became the popular dish that it is today. Sushi was traditionally seen as street food and many vendors could not afford to open brick-and-mortar locations. This all changed after there was an earthquake in 1923. The prices of property dipped so low that it was suddenly attainable to purchase a restaurant and serve sushi there. Now it is far more common to see this being served in an eatery than to see it served on the side of the road.</p>
